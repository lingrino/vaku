# Contributing

I welcome contributions of all types. If you have an idea that you think could improve this project please feel free to create an Issue or Pull Request. If you're unsure if the contribution will be welcome you can create an Issue and I will let you know my thoughts on your idea. Note that this project has a structured way of writing code that I will ask you to conform your own contributions to.

Please keep in mind that these are personal projects and I work on them in my limited personal time. I will respond to all Issues and Pull Requests, but not necessarily in a timely manner.
