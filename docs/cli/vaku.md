## vaku

Vaku is a CLI for working with large Vault k/v secret engines

### Synopsis

Vaku is a CLI for working with large Vault k/v secret engines

The Vaku CLI provides path- and folder-based commands that work on
both Version 1 and Version 2 K/V secret engines. Vaku can help manage
large amounts of Vault data by updating secrets in place, moving
paths or folders, searching secrets, and more.

Vaku is not a replacement for the Vault CLI and requires that you are
already authenticated to Vault before running any commands. Vaku
commands should not be run on non-K/V engines.
